Mirra prepares a separate jailbroken iPhone as a bridge and keeps its connection
available in the background. Apple's iPhone Mirroring app provides the screen,
keyboard, pointer and authentication. **The iPhone you mirror does not need a
jailbreak.**

## Experimental status

Mirra is an independent community project and is not affiliated with Apple.

Mirra is experimental and provides a best-effort compatibility workaround. It
adapts macOS software interfaces and delegates selected cryptographic operations
to the bridge. It does not recreate a complete T2 chip or provide equivalent hardware
security guarantees. It may not work on your devices even when the listed
requirements are met. Compatibility, features and performance depend on devices,
software, drivers and network conditions. Updates may break functionality.

## Features

- Guided bridge setup with verified SSH access and automatic certificate preparation.
- Background support with recovery after bridge connection failures.
- Connection checks before opening iPhone Mirroring.
- Native error dialogs with optional logs.
- System, Light and Dark appearance options.
- Dated logs with seven-day retention and an **Open log folder** action.

## How it works

```mermaid

    A[Mirra] -->|SSH over Wi-Fi or USB| B[Jailbroken bridge iPhone]
    B -->|Cryptographic operations| A
    A --> C[Apple's iPhone Mirroring]
    C <-->|Screen and input| D[Your iPhone]
```

The bridge and the iPhone you mirror are separate devices. Apple's account,
pairing and authentication requirements still apply.

## Get started

Check [host compatibility](#compatibility), including the
[SIP requirement](docs/Installation.md#system-integrity-protection-sip), before setup.

1. Get the app DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/eiyuumiru/Mirra/releases)
   or the maintainer.
2. Open the DMG, drag **Mirra.app** onto **Applications**, then eject the image.
3. Open Mirra and set up a separate jailbroken iPhone running **iOS 15 or later**
   as the bridge, with OpenSSH and `ldid` installed.
   Choose Wi-Fi SSH or select the bridge's USB device and SSH port.
4. Verify the SSH fingerprint and authorize access when prompted.
5. Choose **Prepare connection**, then **Finish setup**.
6. Keep the iPhone you want to mirror locked and nearby with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
   enabled. Choose **Connect** and complete Apple's authentication.

The app includes Python and its helpers. For macOS security prompts and update
instructions, see [Installation](docs/Installation.md).

Settings contains bridge setup, service controls, appearance options and logs.
Your saved setup survives app updates. Closing the Mirra window leaves background
support running. See the [app guide](docs/App.md) for details.

## Compatibility

Mirra targets Intel-based Macs running macOS 15 or later. It checks the required
private framework interfaces before starting support; an OS version alone does
not establish compatibility. Sequoia support is experimental and still needs a live connection
test. The verified reference remains macOS 26.7.2 (`25G332`) with iPhone Mirroring
1.6 (`98.5`).

**Mirra currently does not work with System Integrity Protection (SIP) fully enabled.**
Disable SIP or use a compatible partially enabled configuration on the macOS
host before setting up native support. See
[SIP configuration](docs/Installation.md#system-integrity-protection-sip).

| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Host | Intel `x86_64`, macOS 15 or later with compatible private interfaces |
| SIP on the host | Disabled or a compatible partially enabled configuration; fully enabled SIP is currently unsupported |
| Apple app | Apple's installed iPhone Mirroring 1.x system app |
| Bridge | Compatible jailbroken iPhone running **iOS 15 or later**, with OpenSSH and `ldid`; see [Bridge compatibility](docs/Bridges.md) |
| Target iPhone | Meets [Apple's iPhone Mirroring requirements](https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421) |
| Wi-Fi | Working AWDL support |
| Video | Working H.264 VideoToolbox decoding |

Hackintosh hosts are outside Apple's officially supported configuration.
Bridge compatibility depends on the device, jailbreak and available system APIs.
Display quality and performance depend on the network and decoder; full-resolution
rendering is not guaranteed. See [Media](docs/Media.md) and [Decoder](docs/Decoder.md)
for technical details.

## Build from source

Use Python 3.9 or later, Apple's Command Line Tools and SDKs with the required
framework stubs. See [Building](docs/Build.md) for requirements and checks.

```sh
make app
```

The app is available at `build/Mirra.app`. To create the DMG:

```sh
make package
```

The build downloads a pinned Python runtime and includes its upstream notices.
Packaging produces `Mirra-v<version>.dmg` with an Applications shortcut.
GitHub's **Source code** downloads provide the source for each tagged release.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| SIP fully enabled | Use disabled or compatible partially enabled SIP; see [Installation](docs/Installation.md#system-integrity-protection-sip) |
| Waiting for the bridge | Jailbreak, SSH access and the selected Wi-Fi address or USB device |
| iPhone not found | Target lock state, proximity, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Apple Account |
| Bridge ready but Mirroring fails | Apple's connection error and logs from the same attempt |
| Blank or interrupted video | Wi-Fi/AWDL, decoder logs and [decoder compatibility](docs/Decoder.md) |
| Duplicate Launchpad entries | Keep one installed app and archive development copies |
