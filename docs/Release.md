# Release guide

`VERSION` supplies the release version. `config/release.json` supplies internal
bundle metadata and the repository URL. Package filenames use that version.

The release version is **0.1.2**. Its source version and
[changelog](../CHANGELOG.md#012) are prepared. Local packages can be built and
staged for review; tagging and publication are separate steps.

## Prepare

- Update the changelog and compatibility documentation for the change.
- Run relevant source and native checks, plus device tests for runtime changes.
- Record the host's SIP configuration with live test results. Fully enabled SIP
  is currently unsupported; use disabled or compatible partially enabled SIP.
- Build from a clean checkout or the source for the selected release tag.
- Check the app signature, bundled runtime and third-party notices.
- Mount the DMG, verify the Applications shortcut and test app relocation.
- Review screenshots and exported files for private data.

## Build the DMG

```sh
make package
```

The command creates `Mirra-v<version>.dmg` under `dist/app` and prints its SHA-256.
Stage the selected DMG under `dist/v<version>/` alongside `SHA256SUMS` and
`RELEASE-NOTES.md`, following the v0.1.0 release layout. Keep internal build
numbers out of release asset names. The internal bundle number advances once
per release: v0.1.0 uses 31, v0.1.1 uses 32 and v0.1.2 uses 33.

## Publish

Review the staged source, Git identity and repository remote before committing.
Keep generated builds, private profiles and runtime logs out of version control.
Tag the selected version and attach the app DMG and checksum file to the release.
GitHub automatically provides **Source code (zip)** and **Source code (tar.gz)**
downloads for that tag.

Build and packaging commands create local files; publication is a separate step.
Release notes should identify Mirra as experimental and describe the change,
tested configurations, compatibility limits and signing status. Use the DMG to
install the app and GitHub's source downloads to build it.

[Screenshots](Screenshots.md).
