# Building

## Requirements

Use Python 3.9 or later, Apple's Command Line Tools and a macOS SDK containing
the required private framework stubs. The Python tools use the standard library.
The host and framework restrictions are listed in
[Compatibility](../README.md#compatibility).

All macOS components target Intel `x86_64` and macOS 15.0, including the interface,
password helper and injected adapters. The iPhone endpoint separately targets
arm64 iOS 15. The deployment target is independent of the SDK used to build.

Running Mirra's native support requires SIP disabled or a compatible partially
enabled configuration on the macOS host. Fully enabled SIP is currently
unsupported; see [SIP configuration](Installation.md#system-integrity-protection-sip).

## Build the app

```sh
make app
```

This builds the native interface, adapters, phone endpoint and SSH password
helper. The app is available at `build/Mirra.app`. Completed builds are retained
under `build/versions.noindex`; the app shortcut points to the latest build.

To select an installed SDK explicitly:

```sh
make app SDK=/path/to/MacOSX.sdk
```

Changing the SDK or compiler target rebuilds the native components. The app builder
and packager verify every bundled macOS binary, including Python and its libraries,
and reject a minimum OS newer than 15.0. Run the same audit manually with:

```sh
python3 scripts/deployment.py --app build/Mirra.app
```

These checks verify the binary deployment target. Private framework behavior and
Mirroring connections still need testing on each supported configuration.

The builder downloads a pinned CPython runtime and its upstream notices.
`config/python.json` records archive URLs and checksums. Verified downloads are
cached. The bundled runtime is read-only, and helpers run without writing bytecode
into the signed app. Installed background support receives its own runtime copy.

## Native components

```sh
make build
```

| Output | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `build/keystore.dylib` | Bridge cryptographic operations through sharingd |
| `build/media.dylib` | AWDL media compatibility |
| `build/sockets.dylib` | Delegated socket binds |
| `build/launch.dylib` | Adapter settings during LaunchServices startup |
| `build/decoder-route.dylib` | Optional decoder compatibility hook |
| `build/inspector` | Host and private-interface compatibility report |

`make app` builds all required adapters. See [Architecture](Architecture.md)
for their runtime roles and [Native integration](Native.md) for CLI startup.

## Phone endpoint

```sh
make endpoint
```

The build prefers a full iPhoneOS SDK. A limited `macosx-headers` fallback uses
macOS headers and project-authored link stubs for the required iOS imports.
Select the method explicitly when needed:

```sh
python3 scripts/endpoint.py --sdk iphoneos
python3 scripts/endpoint.py --sdk macosx-headers
```

The output is `build/endpoint`, with an adjacent build report. The deployment
target is iOS 15 with generic arm64. Build and deployment verify the binary's
platform and CPU subtype; API compatibility also needs validation on the bridge.
The fallback is not a general replacement for an iPhoneOS SDK.

The endpoint is signed on the phone during [Bridge setup](Setup.md) using `ldid`
and `config/endpoint.plist`.

The endpoint's [keystore loader](KeyStore.md) keeps normal symbol lookup first
and tries the verified build-specific map only for missing functions. On iOS 15,
it also searches loaded image tables and UUID-matched dyld cache symbol data.
All paths use the same endpoint source, typed API and build command.

## Checks

Run the checks appropriate to the change:

| Command | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `make test` | Python configuration, transport, lifecycle and export tests |
| `make interface` | Native navigation, controls, dialogs, appearance and logs |
| `make authorization` | SSH password helper and secure input channel |
| `make keystore` | Bridge protocol and owned-session cleanup |
| `make media` | Media hook behavior and incompatible-interface rejection |
| `make awdl-service` | Public OCLP symbol lookup, repair guards and object lifetime using fixture classes |
| `make symbols` | Shared keystore loader and image guards using host fixtures |
| `make compatibility` | macOS version and architecture acceptance |
| `make decoder` | Decoder option filtering, stream metadata and argument preservation |
| `make certificate` | Certificate API handling using isolated fixtures |

Native UI tests run as a temporary app through LaunchServices. Device-facing
effects are replaced with fixtures. Test bundles are kept outside Spotlight
indexing and removed afterward.

Changes affecting device setup, authentication or media also need a connected
session on the affected configuration. See [Testing priorities](Roadmap.md).

## Packages

```sh
make package
```

`make package` creates `Mirra-v<version>.dmg` under `dist/app`, containing Mirra.app
and an Applications shortcut. The filename uses `VERSION`; internal bundle
metadata comes from `config/release.json`. The command prints the path and SHA-256.

To build a tagged release, use GitHub's **Source code (zip)** or
**Source code (tar.gz)** download and open the extracted project directory.

For an optional app ZIP after building:

```sh
python3 scripts/package.py --format zip
```

See [Distribution](Distribution.md) for archive contents and verification,
[Installation](Installation.md) for signing prompts, and [NOTICE.md](../NOTICE.md)
for bundled component notices.
